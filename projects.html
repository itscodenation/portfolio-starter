          uses jquery, html, and css.

          This is a project I made in CodeNation using Popcode, to learn how to
          use compound conditionals in jquery. It's a simple little login page
          for a social network name made up for class that doesn't really exist.
          It uses jquery, html, and css.

          This is a site I made with my classmates for the Hackathon with
          CodeNation during my first year. We decided to make an informational
          website about endangered species. I'm not sure why, but this version
          is missing some of the elements, but it still shows the basic purpose
          the site served. The site uses jquery, html, and css.

          I thought this would be a good project to include in my list because
          it's a good example of the practice sessions I did during my first
          uear of CodeNation. We would do exercises like that all the time to
          practive different concepts and refresh ourselves on them. This
          particular project was to remind us of how to use borders and css with
          them to customize our pages. This site uses html, css, and jquery.

        This is a project we made in CodeNation using Glitch, where we practiced storing the
        values of user inputs as variables, to make a website that would calculate
        someone's age. I added a little bit of extra code that calculates the
        user's life expectancy based on the average across the world. The site
        used HTML, CSS, and a lot of jquery.

          This is a website we made during CodeNation class, where we used compound conditionals and functions, which we had just learned, to make a tic tac toe website. It's a tad bit basic, but eh, that's what we knew. It was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
