          This is a silly site I made using Popcode during CodeNation. It uses

          uses jquery, html, and css.

          This is a project I made in CodeNation using Popcode, to learn how to
          use compound conditionals in jquery. It's a simple little login page
          for a social network name made up for class that doesn't really exist.
          It uses jquery, html, and css.

          This is a site I made with my classmates for the Hackathon with
          CodeNation during my first year. We decided to make an informational
          website about endangered species. I'm not sure why, but this version
          is missing some of the elements, but it still shows the basic purpose
          the site served. The site uses jquery, html, and css.

          I thought this would be a good project to include in my list because
          it's a good example of the practice sessions I did during my first
          uear of CodeNation. We would do exercises like that all the time to
          practive different concepts and refresh ourselves on them. This
          particular project was to remind us of how to use borders and css with
          them to customize our pages. This site uses html, css, and jquery.

          This is a project we made in CodeNation using Glitch, where we
          practiced storing the values of user inputs as variables, to make a
          website that would calculate someone's age. I added a little bit of
          extra code that calculates the user's life expectancy based on the
          average across the world. The site used HTML, CSS, and a lot of
          jquery.

          This is a website we made during CodeNation class, where we used
          compound conditionals and functions, which we had just learned, to
          make a tic tac toe website. It's a tad bit basic, but eh, that's what
          we knew. It was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
