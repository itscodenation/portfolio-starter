          Born in Nigeria but raised in Chicago Illinois. Youngest of four children
          and she strayed away from the family path of going into the medical field
          to find something she was interested in. Attended Whitney M. Young Magnet
          High School where she was introducted to Computer science which was an
          graduction requirement. She took it her sophomore year because she was
          scared but when she did, she loved it. She joined
          <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who code, </a>
          did the Summer Immersion Program with JP Morgan Chase bank, and she joined
          Genesys Works which gave her the opportunity to learn swift and work with
          a porfessional company coding. During her Senior year she completed her
          internship at TransUnion which gave her hands on experience working and
          creating with developers. She was very passionate about coding that she
          went on to participate in the Google CSSI program, Code Nation, and many
          more programs because she was very determined to learn as much as
          possible.
