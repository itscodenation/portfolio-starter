      I wanted to create a deeper engagement for our guests at National Geographic Ultimate Explorer through an RFID wristband system – a simple skill tree, guest-tailored missions throughout the park, closer storytelling tie-ins with the different attraction stories and characters, and interleaving educational elements into the digital engagement to accompany the different attraction’s entertainment content.
    </p><p>
This culminated in the Base Camp Field Journal. It features hundreds of attraction-specific achievement badges that guests can earn throughout there day at the park, as well as mission card that challenged guests to answer educationally-relevant questions about animals, science, and conservation. The Field Journal is a personalized digital record of a guest’s amazing journey through NGUX.
    </p><p>
I designed and directed the Field Journal software as well as the Outfitter Station magic mirrors - giant displays that track a guest’s skeletal movements and, based on the achievements they earned, turns the guest (virtually) into several types of explorers, with their face and movements tracked in real-time with included selfie cam.
