      I worked with Adobe on several mobile app initiatives they had internally, mainly centered around the design of apps for sketching, drawing, and painting on a mobile device with the use of a stylus.
    </p><p>
One of them was Brushes, an app I concepted to compliment their drawing experience.
    </p><p>
With this app, artists can take a photo of any surface or texture, and create a dynamic brush from it that can be used in Adobeâ€™s tablet-based drawing apps (like Adobe Sketch) as well as desktop tools (like Adobe Photoshop).
